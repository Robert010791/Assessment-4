  "Don’t just think, act!",
  "Help! I’m being held prisoner in a chinese bakery!",
  "How many of you believe in psycho-kinesis? Raise my hand.",
  "Now is the time to go ahead and pursue that love interest!",
  "One can never fill another’s shoes, rather he must outgrow the old shoes.",
  "Pennies from heaven find their way to your doorstep this year!",
  "Small confidences mark the onset of a friendship.",
  "Soon life will become more interesting.",
  "Today, your mouth might be moving but no one is listening.",
  "When more become too much. It’s same as being not enough."
